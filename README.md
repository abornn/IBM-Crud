Base code for Coding Challenge

### Pre requisites
This is the Guide for the coding challenge that will be X.X.X.X in IBM Guadalajara Campus. Please be sure to read the whole documentation before the date, to have all the prerequisites for the challenge. It is very important to have this prepared for the date, as it is part of the interviewing proccess.

This challenge consist on creating one simple JAVA EE based application, in which you will connect to a database and run Creat, read, update and delete commands. The application will be running in liberty using JAX-rs as a framework.

The first Thing you need to download and configure is Java 8. Use the following link to download the required softwatre:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html
Once you have downloaded Java remember to set up the environmmental variables of your machine with the correct value. JAVA_HOME and PATH (Remember this is only needed in Windows and Linux, for IOS there is the basic installer).

We are going to use maven, to add all the dependencies, so next step is to install apache maven to be able to compile the code.To install Maven we need to go to the following page, and download the binaries files. http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
Once we have downloaded the files we are going to add the folder to the PATH variable and we are going to create the enviroment  variable M2_HOME.If you are running on a MAC run the command brew install maven in any cli you have available.


The last thing we are going to download, this is optional but highly recomended, is IntelliJ Community IDE. If you are used to work with a different IDE such as eclipse or NetBeans feel free to work with it, but be sure it has integration with github and also has maven integration. To download IntelliJ IDE go to this page and download the exceutable. https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/idea/download/#section=windows
Remember to download the COMMUNITY version.
